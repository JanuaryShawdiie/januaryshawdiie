      <h2>What are dumplings made of?</h2>
      <p>The dumpling dough is made of three main ingredients: flour, water and salt. But which flour you use depends on which dumpling you want to make.
         While most dumplings can be made using a standard ‘dumpling’ or ‘wheat’ flour,
         Har Gau (Chinese shrimp dumplings) are made with a mix of wheat and tapioca starch - and that’s just the start!
        In terms of the filling, dumplings are great because they are versatile, much like the Bao Bun. 
        Whether you have a sweet tooth - or if you prefer a more savoury snack, you can make your dumpling to suit your taste and mood!
